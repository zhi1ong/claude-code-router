## When to use it

| Scenario | What to inspect |
| --- | --- |
| Check gateway health | System status, success rate, errors, average latency |
| Estimate recent spend | Requests, input / output / cache tokens, estimated cost |
| Compare upstream usage | Provider analysis, model distribution, client analysis |
| Watch account quota | Balance, subscription quota, remaining quota, account status |
| Report or share usage | AI Usage Wrapped, CCR Route Map, Model Leaderboard, Spend Receipt, and other share cards |

## Time range

The `Usage over time` control at the top drives every widget that depends on usage stats. After you switch ranges, requests, tokens, cost, trends, distribution, and share cards are recomputed for the selected window.

| Option | Window |
| --- | --- |
| `Today` | Current local date from 00:00 to now, bucketed hourly. |
| `24h` | Last 24 hours, bucketed hourly. |
| `7d` | Last 7 days, bucketed daily. |
| `30d` | Last 30 days, bucketed daily. |

The account balance widget does not use this time range. It shows the latest snapshot returned by provider account connectors.

## Edit layout

Click the pencil button in the upper-right corner to enter editing mode. Editing mode has three columns:

| Area | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Components | Left palette. Click a template to add it to the dashboard. |
| Preview | Middle layout preview. Drag widgets to reorder them or click a widget to select it. |
| Component properties | Right property panel for changing type, data, size, style, or removing the selected widget. |

Common operations:

1. Add a widget: click a template in `Components`.
2. Reorder widgets: drag them in `Preview`.
3. Resize a widget: select it, then drag the right, bottom, or bottom-right resize handle.
4. Change data: use `Component category` and `Data` in `Component properties`.
5. Change presentation: choose `Widget size` and `Style`.
6. Save the result: click `Done`; the layout is persisted in app configuration.
7. Restore defaults: click `Reset layout` while editing.

Removing a widget only removes that card from the overview layout. It does not delete request logs, providers, account connectors, or upstream configuration. If all widgets are removed, the page shows `No widgets configured`.

## Widget catalog

Sizes are written as `width:height`, with both dimensions from `1` to `4`. The overview grid has up to 4 columns on desktop and collapses automatically on narrow screens.

| Widget | Data | Default size | Default style | Styles |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Status component | System status | `4:1` | Timeline | Timeline, Compact |
| Account component | All accounts or one account | `4:2` | Cards | Cards, Compact, Bars, Ring, Semicircle, Arc, Nested rings |
| Metric component | Requests, tokens, cost | `1:1` | Cards | Cards, Compact, Bar, Ring |
| Trend component | Usage over time | `3:2` | Composed | Composed, Area, Line, Bar |
| Activity component | Token activity | `4:2` | Heatmap | Heatmap |
| Breakdown component | Token distribution / Model distribution | Token distribution: `1:2`; Model distribution: `2:2` | Token distribution: Bars; Model distribution: Pie | Bars, Stacked, Donut, Pie |
| Analysis component | Client Analysis / Provider Analysis | `2:2` | Table | Table, Compact |
| Share card | AI Usage Wrapped, CCR Route Map, Model Leaderboard, AI Fuel Cockpit, Token Calendar Poster, Spend Receipt | `1:4` | Card | Card |

Size constraints:

| Rule | Reason |
| --- | --- |
| Share cards have a minimum size of `1:4`. | PNG export uses a vertical poster ratio and needs enough height. |
| The account widget has a minimum size of `2:2` when showing All accounts with the Compact style. | Multi-account lists need readable space. |
| Legacy aliases are still accepted: `small` -> `1:1`, `medium` / `large` -> `2:2`, `wide` -> `3:2`, `full` -> `4:1` or `4:2`. | Backward compatibility for older config. |

## Analysis data

Client Analysis aggregates usage by the ID of the API key used to access CCR and displays its name. Requests using the same key share one row across models, providers, and upstream credentials. Separate keys with the same name remain separate rows, with their IDs shown below the name.

Historical usage recovers key information from matching request logs when available. Requests without a known key share an “Unidentified API key” row. Provider Analysis continues to break usage down by provider, upstream credential, and model.

## Metric data

`metric` widgets use the `metric` field to choose the displayed value.

| `metric` | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `requests` | Request count |
| `total-tokens` | Total tokens |
| `input-tokens` | Input tokens |
| `output-tokens` | Output tokens |
| `cache-tokens` | Cache tokens |
| `cache-ratio` | Cache ratio |
| `estimated-cost` | Estimated cost, calculated from model pricing data |
| `success-rate` | Success rate |
| `errors` | Error count |
| `avg-latency` | Average latency |

## Account widget

The account widget reads provider account / usage connectors. To show balance or remaining quota, first enable and test `Fetch usage` in provider configuration.

| Data selection | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `All accounts` | Shows every available account snapshot. |
| One account | Shows only one provider or credential snapshot. The internal config value is usually `provider` or `provider::credentialId`. |

If the account widget is empty, check:

1. Whether the provider has an account / usage connector configured.
2. Whether the `Fetch usage` test succeeds.
3. Whether the API key or account endpoint is still valid.
4. Whether the selected account was deleted or renamed.

## Share cards

Share card widgets can export PNGs through the download button in the card header. The desktop app uses native export when available; browser environments fall back to frontend canvas export. The exported image size is `1080 x 1350`.

| Card | `type` | Content |
| --- | --- | --- |
| AI Usage Wrapped | `share-usage-wrapped` | Total tokens, requests, estimated cost, cache ratio, longest activity streak, top model, top provider, peak day. |
| CCR Route Map | `share-route-map` | Main client-to-provider/model route relationships, plus client, provider, and model counts. |
| Model Leaderboard | `share-model-leaderboard` | Models ranked by tokens. |
| AI Fuel Cockpit | `share-fuel-cockpit` | Up to 3 account quota gauges. Requires account / usage connectors. |
| Token Calendar Poster | `share-token-calendar` | Contribution-calendar style token activity poster. |
| Spend Receipt | `share-spend-receipt` | Estimated cost, requests, tokens, latency, and success rate for the selected range. |

## Data sources and troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause | What to do |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Requests, tokens, or cost are 0 | No requests went through CCR in the selected range, or usage capture has not recorded data yet. | Try `24h` / `7d`, and confirm the client is actually using CCR. |
| Cost shows `$0.00` | The model has no pricing data, or usage is very small. | Check model catalog matching and provider model names; values under 0.01 USD are shown with extra decimals. |
| Success rate or errors look unexpected | The overview only aggregates request results captured by CCR. | Compare with records on the Logs page. |
| Account balance is empty | No account connector exists, or `Fetch usage` failed. | Test account / usage field mapping in provider configuration. |
| Distribution charts have no data | Request logs lack model, provider, or token information. | Confirm requests go through CCR and upstream responses include token usage. |
| PNG export fails | Canvas export is unavailable, the element has no size, or the save dialog was canceled. | Retry in the desktop app, and make sure the card is visible and not resized too small. |
